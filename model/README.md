## Facial KeyPoint Estimation Model

This folder contains the code for a facial keypoint estimation model based on the ResNet50 architecture. The model is trained to detect two key facial landmarks: the top of the head and the chin. These keypoints can be used to control various applications, such as games or virtual reality environments.

## Training the Model

To train the model, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
